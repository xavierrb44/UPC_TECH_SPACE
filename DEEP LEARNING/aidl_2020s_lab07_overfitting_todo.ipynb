        "We will start replicating the imports, Dataset and training/evaluation routines from the last labs (MLPs and CNNs). Nonetheless, we will work with the [CIFAR-10 Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). This dataset contains 50.000 training images of 10 classes and 10.000 test images. Does it sound familiar? Yes! MNIST follows a similar structure, but CIFAR contains natural images (planes, dogs, cars, ...) whereas MNIST has quite simplistic patterns that would not allow us to appreciate the challenges that appear when we transfer from training data to evaluation data. \n",
        "\n",
        "We will refer to evaluation data to the so called validation data. Typically we have two splits during model development and a final split to test it to report results. The former splits are training (obviously) and validation/evaluation. Validation is useful to check how our model performs out of the training corpus. If the model is good at both training and validation, then our model is prone to \"generalize\" to the test data (real world data). If our model is very good at training and very bad at validation... well you will see later on in this lab the concept... but obviously the model must be changed to get better at validation data as well as training data. Once all this development is done and we match the performance on both splits, we can test the model with data that is non-related at all to the training process.\n",
        "\n",
        "**NOTE:** in this lab we do not have test data. We consider the CIFAR test split as our validation set to check how model changes affect generalization. Do not let this misguide you. This is just for learning purposes. So we emulate the validation set with the CIFAR test set for convenience only, do not forget."

In deep learning, the number of learnable parameters in a model is often referred to as the model's \"capacity\". Intuitively, a model with more parameters will have more \"memorization capacity\" and therefore will be able to easily learn a perfect dictionary-like mapping between training samples and their targets, a mapping without any generalization power. For instance, a model with 500,000 binary parameters could easily be made to learn the class of every digits in the MNIST training set: we would only need 10 binary parameters for each of the 50,000 digits. Such a model would be useless for classifying new digit samples. Always keep this in mind: deep learning models tend to be good at fitting to the training data, **but the real challenge is generalization, not fitting**.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, if the network has limited memorization resources, it will not be able to learn this mapping as easily, and thus, in order to minimize its loss, it will have to resort to learning compressed representations that have predictive power regarding the targets -- precisely the type of representations that we are interested in. At the same time, keep in mind that **you should be using models that have enough parameters that they won't be underfitting: your model shouldn't be starved for memorization resources**. There is a compromise to be found between \"too much capacity\" and \"not enough capacity\".\n",

You will have to evaluate an array of different architectures (on your validation set, not on your test set, of course) in order to find the right model size for your data. The general workflow to find an appropriate model size is to start with relatively few layers and parameters, and start increasing the size of the layers or adding new layers until you see diminishing returns with regard to the validation loss.\n",

In terms of accuracy, however, there is not much difference, and can even get a bit worse (depending on the seed). In general, reducing the network size is a viable strategy but might no be a good one, as we might be impeding a needed set of parameters by the model that we can instead \"guide\" to learn in a better way. In other words, reducing the model size can lead to capacity limitation, so that the model overfits slowly but reaches worse quotas.

        "\n",
        "Dropout is one of the most effective and most commonly used regularization techniques for neural networks, developed by Hinton and his students at the University of Toronto. Dropout, applied to a layer, consists of randomly \"dropping out\" (i.e. setting to zero) a number of output features of the layer during training. Let's say a given layer would normally have returned a vector [0.2, 0.5, 1.3, 0.8, 1.1] for a given input sample during training; after applying dropout, this vector will have a few zero entries distributed at random, e.g. [0, 0.5, 1.3, 0, 1.1]. The \"dropout rate\" is the fraction of the features that are being zeroed-out; it is usually set between 0.2 and 0.5. At test time, no units are dropped out, and instead the layer's output values are scaled down by a factor equal to the dropout rate, so as to balance for the fact that more units are active than at training time.\n",
        "\n",
        "This technique may seem strange and arbitrary. Why would this help reduce overfitting? Geoff Hinton has said that he was inspired, among other things, by a fraud prevention mechanism used by banks -- in his own words: \"I went to my bank. The tellers kept changing and I asked one of them why. He said he didn’t know but they got moved around a lot. I figured it must be because it would require cooperation between employees to successfully defraud the bank. This made me realize that randomly removing a different subset of neurons on each example would prevent conspiracies and thus reduce overfitting\".\n",
        "\n",
        "The core idea is that introducing noise in the output values of a layer can break up happenstance patterns that are not significant (what Hinton refers to as \"conspiracies\"), which the network would start memorizing if no noise was present.\n",
